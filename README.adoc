= Credit Card Fraud Detection Integration Service

This service implements the integration routing of the Credit Card Fraud Detection Demo. 
It is responsible for routing events from a Kafka Stream Topic to the Red Hat Process Automation Service.

== Initial setup

Before running this service you need to spin up a Kafka cluster and a Process Server (RHPAM).
After configuring these two components you can specify the connection properties in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] config file.

> the process project can be imported into Business Central from https://github.com/rafaeltuelho/[this repository]

You can use the following endpoint to generate some test msgs into Kafka Topic:

`POST` `http://localhost:8181/camel/trigger`

```json
{
  "triggerId": "1",
  "memberId": "0987654321"
}
```

== Stream load

You can use https://jmeter.apache.org/[Apache JMeter] with https://github.com/GSLabDev/pepper-box[Pepper Box plugin] to load about 10m triggers using this JMeter Test plan link:JMteter_kafka_topic_load_plan.jmx[jmeter/JMteter_kafka_topic_load_plan.jmx]

> before running the test plan make sure your local kafka cluster is up&running.
> expects zookeper listening on `localhost:2181` and broker on `localhost:9092`

> the Pepper Box plugin JAR file is avaiable inside the `jmeter/` dir. Before start JMeter copy this JAR into the `JMETER_HOME/lib/ext`

== Deployment options

You can run this service in the following modes:

* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to use this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

IMPORTANT: This project requires Java 8 JDK or later and Maven 3.3.x or later.

=== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images
To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image {image-name-version} --from={image-registry}{image-prefix}{image-name-version} --confirm
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -Dfabric8.generator.fromMode=istag -Dfabric8.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/{image-name-version}
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `PHM-integration-service` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `PHM-integration-service` application. The URL uses this form:
`http://PHM-integration-service-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the greetings service application and then follow the instructions on that page.

== Running the booster standalone on your machine

To run this booster as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the services:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. Go to link:http://localhost:8181[] and then follow the instructions on that page.
